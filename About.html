        <h2>Cool Facts!</h2>
        <p>Your dog is as smart as a 2-year-old toddler. Theres a reason your toddler and your pup get along so well: they speak the same language. 
        Or at least, they likely understand roughly the same number of words and gestures 250! Your one year-old pup is as physically mature as a 15-year-old human.
        Of course, different breeds age a little differently. Large dogs age faster than small ones.Your dog can smell your feelings.
        Your pup can pick up on subtle changes in your scent, which can help him figure out how you are feeling such as by smelling your perspiration when you become nervous or fearful. 
        Its also likely how dogs can detect certain diseases or know that a household member is pregnant.</p>
        
        <p>Puppies have 28 teeth and normal adult dogs have 42. Dogs eyes contain a special membrane, called the tapetum lucidum, which allows them to see in the dark. 
        Dogs noses secrete a thin layer of mucous that helps them absorb scent. They then lick their noses to sample the scent through their mouth.
        Unlike humans who sweat everywhere, dogs only sweat through the pads of their feet.</p>
        
        <p>Strive for structure and consistency in your pet daily routine to give him a healthy feeling of stability as a member of the family. 
        The relationship between your family and your new family member can be great if you are patient and positive. 
        You should also select a veterinarian with whom you are comfortable, since you'll need to bring your pet in for regular checkups. 
        Finally, find out what the local pet laws are (such as leash laws) and what the licensing requirements are for dogs in your area. 
        Before you bring your new dog home, there are a number of ways that you can prepare for the new addition to your family. 
        First, get the dog an ID tag with your information on it (name, phone number, address).</p>
