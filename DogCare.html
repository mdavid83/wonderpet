        <p>Bathing: The ASPCA recommends bathing your dog at least once every three months, but some may require more frequent baths if he or she spends a lot of time outdoors or has skin problems. </p>
        <p>Exercise: Long walks are recommended at least 3 to 4 times daily.</p>
        <p>Grooming: Brushing on a regular helps maintain a good coat.</p>
        <p>Food: A nutritionally balanced diet is key. Your pet should have constant access to a bowl of fresh, clean drinking water </p>

        <p> There are many fun things to do with your dog. Dogs gain confidence, release energy and learn how to stay focused while in high spirits.  
        Your pet needs daily, loving interaction with you and a social life. Socialize your pet by bringing him on car rides, letting him be around children and other animals, taking him to the groomer, 
        shopping with him at pet food stores (some of them let you bring your dog in), and walking him in public places. These are some examples of activities you can enjoy with your canine friend!<p>
